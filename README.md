A clean and fast Astro SaaS Starter template.

## Getting started

Start by [generating a new repository based on this project](https://github.com/riipandi/saastro/generate).

After cloning (or downloading) the repository to your local machine, install all dependencies with the command

```sh
pnpm install
```

## Up and running

The project comes with Astro‚Äôs built-in development server. You can start the server with:

```sh
pnpm dev
```

To trigger a production build, use

```sh
pnpm build
```

## Deploy your own

You'll want to fork this repository and deploy your own Next.js website. Once you have an
image generator that sparks joy, you can setup [automatic GitHub](https://vercel.com/github)
deployments so that pushing to master will deploy to production! üöÄ

[![Deploy to Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/riipandi/saastro&project-name=saastro&repo-name=saastro&env=PUBLIC_SITE_URL)
[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/riipandi/saastro)

#### Cloudflare Deployment

You need to add `NODE_VERSION` with value `18.17.1` or `20.11.0` on the environment variables setting.
Visit [Cloudflare pages docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/build-configuration/)
for more information.

Example environment variables for the preview branch:

```env

| :------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `pnpm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`      |
| `pnpm run build`           | Build your production site to `.output/`         |
| `pnpm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `pnpm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `pnpm run astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |

## Development

This project uses TypeScript for type checking, [Biome][biome] for code formatting
and linting which is configured in [`biome.json`](./biome.json). It's recommended
to get TypeScript set up for your editor and install an editor plugin (like the
[VSCode Biome plugin][vscode-biome]) to get auto-formatting on saving and get a
really great in-editor experience with type checking and auto-complete.
